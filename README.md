# Voxel Engine Devlog
#### Ryan Nicholas Permana

This is a devlog for my voxel engine project. I'll be updating this as I make progress on the project.

### Day 1 (2024-05-26) - First entry!
I've started working on a voxel engine. I'm not sure what I'm going to do with it yet, but I'm excited to see where it goes!
- Configured the project and set up the initial structure.
- Made use of VcXsrv for the first time, and it's working great!
- CMake is a bit of a pain, but the initial setup is always the hardest part.
- Got a successful build with a blank window. It's a start!

### Day 2 (2024-05-30) - Rendering shapes, playing with shaders.
Was busy the past couple of days, but managed to get some time to work on it again today. The goal for today is to familiarize myself with OpenGL and get some basic shapes rendering. Maybe play around with some simple colors and shaders.
- Got a rotating colored triangle rendering on the screen!

### Day 3 (2024-06-17) - Rendering a cube, camera movement.
Been a while, super busy lately. Today I got a Block class set up and rendering a cube. Also got started on basic player camera movement and input handling.
- Got a cube rendering on the screen!
- Got camera movement working!
- Got flying with WASD/Space/Shift working!
- BONUS: added alternate shader for wireframe rendering (press P to toggle)
